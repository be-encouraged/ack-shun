# ACK-SHUN

bang! pow!

## What even is this?

This is a little testing/playground setup for using GitHub hosted runners with teleport.sh  

It's really easy to do with linux runners (officially supported, vendor maintained actions), but I wanted to see if I could get it to work woth macos GH hosted runners.
